To determine if a number is even or odd in Java, the most common method involves using the modulo operator (%).

Using the Modulo Operator (%)

Concept: An even number is perfectly divisible by 2, meaning it leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2. An odd number, on the other hand, leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.

Implementation:
This code prompts the user to enter an integer.
It then uses the if-else statement to check the condition number % 2 == 0.
If the condition is true (remainder is 0), the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.
