Printing patterns in Java typically involves using nested loops. The outer loop controls the number of rows, and the inner loop controls the elements (characters, numbers, or spaces) printed in each row.

Here is an example of printing a right-angled triangle star pattern:

Explanation:

int rows = 5;:
This line declares an integer variable rows and initializes it to 5, determining the height of the triangle.

for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++):
This is the outer loop, which iterates from 1 up to the value of rows. Each iteration of this loop represents a new row in the pattern.

for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++):
This is the inner loop, which iterates from 1 up to the current value of i (the row number). This loop controls how many stars are printed in the current row. Since j goes up to i, the number of stars increases with each subsequent row.

System.out.print("* ");:
Inside the inner loop, this statement prints a star followed by a space. Using print() instead of println() keeps the stars on the same line.

System.out.println();:
After the inner loop completes (meaning all stars for the current row have been printed), this statement moves the cursor to the next line, preparing for the next row of the pattern.
