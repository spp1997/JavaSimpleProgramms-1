Explanation:

Variable Declaration and Initialization:

int number1 = 10; and int number2 = 25; declare two integer variables and assign them initial values.

Addition Operation:
int sum = number1 + number2; performs the addition. The + operator adds the values of number1 and number2, and the result is stored in the sum variable.

Output:

System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum); prints the calculated sum to the console.
Other Methods for Adding Numbers:
User Input: You can use the Scanner class to read numbers from the user and then add them.
Methods: You can encapsulate the addition logic within a method for reusability.
Compound Assignment Operator: The += operator can be used to add a value to an existing variable and assign the result back to the same variable (e.g., number1 += number2; is equivalent to number1 = number1 + number2;).
